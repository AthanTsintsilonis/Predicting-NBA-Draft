# Predicting Player Draft Position Using a Linear Regression Algorithm 

#Description

This project aims to predict a players draft position based on their combine measurements and college statistics. This is done is two main steps: 
1. Scraping and prepping the appropriate data (Scraper)
2. Constructing a Linear Regression Model to predict draft position (Linear Regression Model)

It is still currently a work in progress
